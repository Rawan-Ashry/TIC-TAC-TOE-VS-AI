# 🎮 Tic Tac Toe with Enhanced AI  

This project is a Python-based **Tic Tac Toe** game where a human player competes against an unbeatable AI. The game is implemented using **Pygame** for a graphical interface and leverages the **Minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning** to ensure the AI always makes optimal moves.

## ✨ Features  
- 🔥 **Unbeatable AI**: Powered by the Minimax algorithm, making it impossible to lose.  
- 🖥️ **Interactive GUI**: Built with **Pygame** for an engaging, visually appealing experience.  
- 🚀 **Smooth Gameplay**: Clear visuals, intuitive controls, and instant feedback.  
- ⚡ **Optimized Algorithm**: Alpha-beta pruning enhances the AI's performance by reducing computation time.

## 🕹️ How It Works  
1. **Game Start**: The game begins with an empty 3x3 board.  
2. **Player vs. AI**: Play as either `X` or `O` and challenge the AI.  
3. **AI Decision Making**: The AI calculates the best move in real-time using the Minimax algorithm.  
4. **Game End**: The game concludes when a player wins or the board is full (draw).
